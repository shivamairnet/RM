For payments made by RouteMaestro-initiated bank transfer (“Auto Debit”), RouteMaestro shall provide an invoice to Customer in advance of the payment due date and RouteMaestro will then initiate a debit transaction on the designated account on the payment due date.  Customer’s selection of Auto Debit constitutes Customer’s authorization for RouteMaestro to initiate such debit transactions.  RouteMaestro may draw or transmit funds to its own order for any payments.<br>
                    8.3. Management Fee. For certain services or features, RouteMaestro’s preferred payment method is Auto Debit. Customer may, however, elect to use Credit Transactions or another payment method for such payments; provided, however, that RouteMaestro will charge a service fee (the “Management Fee”).  Any such Management Fee will be specified in the Service Order and will be payable using the same payment method, and on the same payment terms, as the underlying payment amount.<br>
                    8.4. Taxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, VAT) (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes associated with its purchase of Services and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any Fees, other than any taxes based on RouteMaestro’s net income, property, or employees. If RouteMaestro is legally required to collect and remit Taxes which the Customer is responsible for, RouteMaestro will state such Taxes separately on an invoice and Customer shall pay the Taxes to RouteMaestro unless Customer provides RouteMaestro with a valid tax exemption certificate with order. If RouteMaestro is not legally required to collect and remit Taxes which the Customer is responsible for, there will be no Taxes stated on the invoice, and Customer shall self-assess and remit all taxes to the appropriate governing authority. For all non-USA based transactions, the Customer shall self-assess any related Taxes, including but not limited to VAT and GST. Customer is responsible for all withholding tax: Taxes will not be deducted from Customer payments to RouteMaestro, except as required by applicable law, in which case Customer shall increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, RouteMaestro will receive and retain an amount equal to the amount RouteMaestro would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. Upon RouteMaestro’s request, Customer will provide proof of withholding tax remittance to the applicable tax authority. Both parties agree to apply any applicable tax treaty and provide the necessary documentation for application of such treaty, where applicable, to reduce the withholding tax. With respect to Taxes charged on or applicable to the purchase or sale of Travel Services, RouteMaestro shall reflect such Taxes in invoices and/or in the reporting available to Customer on the RouteMaestro Site, and Customer shall be responsible for the payment of all such Taxes.<br>
                    8.5. Local Currency. All Fees will be billed and charged in INR unless otherwise stated in the Service Order. Trip Fees will be invoiced in the currency indicated on the applicable Service Order. Any currency conversion required for Trip Fees will be undertaken at the time of the purchase, at the exchange rate applicable at that time. To the extent a currency conversion is required for Fees that are invoiced to Customer, the conversion will be undertaken at the last day of the invoice period, at the exchange rate applicable at that time.<br>
                    8.6. Late Payments. If RouteMaestro is unable to obtain payment of any Fees or Charges via the payment information on file or if payment of Fees or Charges is otherwise overdue, RouteMaestro may, in its discretion: (i) apply interest on past due amounts at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, but in no event greater than the highest rate of interest allowed by law, calculated from the date such amount was due until the date that payment is received by RouteMaestro; (ii) debit from Customer’s Reserve Amount, if applicable; and/or (iii) suspend Customer’s access to the Services if Fees or Charges remain overdue after reasonable notice (no less than fourteen (14) days for Fees; no less than three (3) days for Charges) is provided to Customer. Except as otherwise set forth in an applicable Service Order, Fees and Charges are non-refundable.<br>
                    8.7. Disputed Fees or Charges. RouteMaestro shall not pursue its rights under Section 8.6 with respect to Fees or Charges that are under a reasonable, good faith dispute which Customer is cooperating diligently to resolve.  Customer may dispute any Fees or Charges by contacting ar@RouteMaestro.com within thirty (30) days after the Fees or Charge are invoiced or are posted to Customer’s account (as applicable).  RouteMaestrp will review the dispute and address the disputed item(s) in its reasonable discretion.  Fees and Charges not disputed within the thirty-day period shall be deemed to have been agreed to by Customer.</p>

Each party shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the other’s Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the terms of the Agreement, but in no event will either party use less effort to protect the Confidential Information of the other party than it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like importance. Each party will ensure that any agents or subcontractors that are permitted to access any of the other’s Confidential Information are legally bound to comply with the obligations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed as required by any governmental agency, provided that before disclosing such information the receiving party must provide (to the extent permitted by applicable law) the disclosing party with sufficient advance notice of the agency’s request for the information to provide the disclosing party an opportunity to exercise any rights it may have to challenge or limit the agency’s authority to receive such Confidential Information.<br>
                    10.2. Post-Termination Obligations. The receiving party’s obligations to guard the disclosing party’s Confidential Information will survive for a period of five (5) years after expiration or termination of the Agreement, except that personal information within a party’s reasonable control shall be kept confidential in perpetuity until such personal information is returned or deleted. Personal information may be deleted through obfuscation. The receiving party may retain an archival copy of the Confidential Information to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or archival policies, provided that such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to all confidentiality obligations under the Agreement.<br>

RouteMaestro shall promptly notify Customer of any confirmed Security Incident that has impacted Customer Data, investigate, and remediate any such Security Incident. RouteMaestro shall have no responsibility to pay Breach Costs related to a Security Incident to the extent such costs are due to the negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by Customer or its Users.</p>

                <p>12.1. Term. The term of the Agreement shall be as set forth in the applicable Service Order (“Term”).  The Agreement shall commence on the date set forth in the Service Order (or, if no Service Order is in place, then on the date that RouteMaestro notifies Customer that it has approved Customer to begin using the Services) and shall continue until it expires or is earlier terminated as provided in the Agreement.  Commencement of the Services shall be determined by the Parties and included in the applicable Service Order.  Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Service Order, the Term shall automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Term unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the expiring Term.  RouteMaestro reserves the right to increase any Fees upon automatic renewal, provided the increase is not more than five percent (5%) per annum. <br>
                    12.2. Termination for Cause. If either party commits a material breach of its obligations in the Agreement or any Service Order (including payment obligations), the non-defaulting party may give written notice to the defaulting party specifying the nature of the default, and if such default is not remedied, or substantial efforts are not made to remedy such default, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice, then the non-defaulting party shall have the right to immediately terminate the Agreement or the Service Order by written notice. If the breach relates solely to one Service Order or Service, then only that Service Order or Service may be terminated in accordance with the terms herein and the other Service Orders and the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that Customer terminates in accordance with the Agreement, Customer shall be entitled to a pro-rated refund of unused, prepaid Fees as of the date of termination.<br>
                    12.3. Termination for Insolvency.

                    12.4. Rights and Obligations Upon Expiration or Termination. In no event shall any termination or expiration relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any undisputed Fees or Charges payable to RouteMaestro for the period prior to the effective date of termination or expiration.  Provided RouteMaestro is not terminating for cause under Section 12.2 and upon Customer’s request, RouteMaestro will reasonably cooperate with Customer in a wind-down of Services prior to termination of a Service or of the Agreement.  Customer shall be responsible for downloading any Customer Data and/or reporting available within the Services prior to the date of expiration or termination.  Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, (i) Customer’s and Users’ right to access and use the Services shall immediately terminate, (ii) Customer and its Users shall immediately cease all use of the Services, (iii) RouteMaestro shall cease use of the Customer Marks within a reasonable time, and (iv) each party shall delete or return, and make no further use of, any Confidential Information, materials, or other items (and all copies thereof) belonging to the other party, in accordance with Section 10.<br>
